## Configure VM resources from RVTools output file

This script reads the values from an RVTOOLs output file, then sets the VMs in vCenter to these resources.

This script was created for a customer who had to restore VMs from backups but needed to ensure the resources provided for the VMs were the same as the last RVTools output.
